						/> Student number: S3851560<br /> Email Address:
						S3851560@student.rmit.edu.au<br /> <br /> I live in Adelaide, I am
						married to my wife Tamara and we have 3 cats. I spend my free time
						playing Dungeons and Dragons and board games with my friends. I am
						part of the organising committee for the Adelaide Browncoats, a fan
						club of the TV show Firefly and film Serenity, where we plan movie
						screenings and fundraising events to raise money for charity. This
						year I participated in the Relay for Life and my team raised $3,400
						for the Cancer Council. I enjoy fun-runs and obstacle courses, as I
						aim to improve my fitness and live a healthier lifestyle. </p>

						class="major">Interest in IT</h2> <h3>My interest in IT</h3> <p>I
						have always been interested in IT, but I've never really had a
						opportunity to act on my desire to learn more about it. When I
						finished school I had several jobs in hospitality and chose to
						persue my career without going to university. I eventually ended up
						working for Telstra as a technician and was recently involved in the
						configuing and upgrade of new pc’s to all the Adelaide staff and
						that has reignighted my desire to learn more about IT. I feel that
						furthering my knowledge and understanding of IT may also help with
						my career as a technician moving forward. <br /><br /> I developed
						an interest in programming after using an unsuitable dispatch
						program at my workplace. It has been adapted from it's original
						function to what we require and because of this it freezes and
						reloads when we are halfway through a function. One memorable time
						after an update, it wouldn’t allow punctuation in the comments
						section, in which I needed to write a paragraph. I couldn't figure
						out why I was getting an error and couldn’t complete the job in the
						system (I only found out a week later what caused the problem). It
						made me want to learn programming so I could understand why it was
						doing these things, and theoretically how I could fix and improve
						it.<br /></p> Nearly all of my friends are programmers, which is
						another reason I want to further my IT knowledge, so I understand
						what they talk about and can contribute to their conversations.   I
						have also been influenced by recent changes to the industry in which
						I currently work as the amount of work has been on the decline, due
						to outsourcing, switching to cheaper contractors rather than staff,
						and more user friendly (plug and play) technology is replacing the
						need for a technician to come to your house to set up your router.
						<br /><br /> I have a certificate 3 in Telecommunications and I am
						trained in the following: <br /> Copper jointing, cabling and fault
						finding<br /> Structured cabling (Cat5and Cat6)<br /> Fibre Optic
						splicing<br /> Coaxial cabling, jointing and fault finding<br /> IT
						support for other staff in my section<br /> Windows upgrades and
						national roll out of new PC’s<br /> Into to Networking & TCP/IP </p>

<h3>Why RMIT?</h3> <p> I chose to study online as this was the best option while
working full time and an online university course can fit around my daily
schedule. I want to get a new job and it is the only was to get qualified while
working full time. RMIT offered the course I wanted and seemed to be one of the
best rated online universities.</p>

<h3>What do I expect to learn?</h3> <p>I expect to learn programming in my
Bachelor of IT studies and I expect to be a qualified, competent and employable
programmer at the end of the course and able to get a job in the field. I hope
that as part of this course it will give me a better understanding of the
different aspects of IT so that I can pick a direction to refine my studies.</p>

						Add Link: Java - Web Developer</a></p></h3> </div>

						<h3>Description of the Postion</h3> <p>The position is for a web
						developer, who has plenty of experience with Java and can work with
						technical and creative teams to create great custom websites.
						This job appeals to me as it describes “making experiences people
						love” which is something that I want to achieve with programming. The
						advert describes a relaxing studio atmosphere and an active social
						club, which both sound appealing. </p>

						<h3>Skills and Qualifications Required</h3> <p>The position requires
						me to have at least 5 years experience in Java, HTML, CSS & Jscript.
						It also speaks of programs called Tomcat and Maven which I have no
						knowledge of as well as looking for someone who is good at time
						management and documentation systems like Version control and Issue
						tracking, and being able to work within a team. </p>

						<h3>Skills and Qualifications I have</h3> <p>I currently don’t have
						any of the formal qualifications required for this position, but I
						believe I do have time management, prioritisation and organisational
						skills required. I am resourceful and enjoy problem solving.
						Improving an application is my project idea. I have spent the last 7
						years working in technical support, teaching people from all
						backgrounds how to use their IT equipment so I have a lot of
						experience explaining in layman’s terms how complex technology
						works. I feel that I am skilled in working in technical and
						non-technical teams.    </p>

						<h3>The Plan</h3> <p>I am going to finish this degree and then look
						for a position that will allow me to gain experience in Maven & Tomcat
						while building on the skills I will learn in this course. Ideally I
						would get an entry level web design position so that I can keep my
						Java and CSS skills up to date while furthering my knowledge and
						gaining experience.   </p></div>

						<h3>Personality Test Results </h3> <p>Result of Myers-Briggs test:
						ISFP (Introvert, Sensing, Feeling, Perceiving) [1]<br /> Result of
						online learning style test: Visual [2]<br /> Result of Type Finder
						test: INFP (Introvert, Intuition, Feeling, Perceiving) [3]<br />
						Result of Institute of Psychometric mechanical test: 7/10 [4]<br />
						</p> <h3>Interpritation of Results</h3> <p>The test results show
						that I am a quiet and introverted person, who explores ideas and
						concepts, and who considers the effect I have on others. I can be
						flexible and adaptable while having a above average ability to
						reason out mechanical principles.<br /></p>  <p>I get along well
						with others, but I’m not much of a leader as it doesn’t come
						naturally to me.<br /> </p> <p>I need to be aware that I will need
						make an effort to communicate more when working in a team, and while
						I am flexible and easy going, I should think about my opinions and
						express them in group decision making. </p>

				<!-- Footer --> <section id="footer"> <div class="inner"> <h2
				class="major">Project Idea</h2> <p>My project idea is to write a job
				dispatching program that can be used to input job data, create a ticket
				of work for an employee to follow, allow for progress photos to be taken
				of the work undertaken by the employee, compresses and uploads those
				photos to a central server as the employee saves them, thus reducing
				load when the ticket of work is completed. Will allow for the employee
				to enter detailed comments of the work conducted, and select materials
				and additional charges, which will then be automatically compiled into
				an invoice to be sent to the customer. <br /></p>

Promise is the name of a program that I use at work. It is difficult to use, as
it is poorly adapted to the specific functions my employer requires me to use it
for. My project is to write a better program, specifically suited to the
functions required, so all my fellow employees are not wasting time and becoming
disillusioned trying to use a program to complete their work that lets them down
in so many ways. I want to create a program that is very intuitive, so users
will feel like they have used this program for years.<br /></p>

This program will have a main page, where jobs will have a summary displayed so
the technicians can organise their day. Once the technician opens the job, there
will be 4 pages; the Details tab, the Testing tab, the Closure tab and the
Artefacts tab.<br /> The Details tab will include: <br /> •	The work order
number <br/> •	Customer address <br /> •	Customer contact information <br /> •
Cable details, including locations of the exchange, cabinet and pillar <br /> •
A description of the fault, including fault as described by the customer when
reported, test results and the location of faults that have been fixed recently.
<br /> •	A scope of the work required by a 3rd party should the job be contract
work. <br /> </p> The testing tab will have access to online testing through the
company’s testing facility, which will return a result in approximately 1
minute.  The type of test will be selectable from a drop-down menu; Electrical
line test and RVOP tests will be amongst the others, these will test the copper
line for electrical faults and modem connectivity respectively.  Under the
drop-down menu mentioned above, there will be a text window which will display
the test results, of either a copper line test (showing the results of
electrical line test) or the modem test (showing if a modem is connected, the
connection speeds, maximum connection speeds, noise margin and mac address). <br
/> </p> The closure tab will have ‘Complete’ and ‘Incomplete’ buttons, which
when selected will display the relevant options.  The incomplete page will have
a drop-down menu to select the reason the job can’t be completed. It will also
have access to the companies’ materials portal, and materials used can be
searched for, selected and added to the ticket. There will also be a comments
box in which the technician can elaborate on the reason for the incomplete.
There will then be a submit function and a confirmation prompt to ensure the
jobs are not closed off before all relevant information is included. <br /></p>
The completion page will show the relevant options for completion, as well as
billable items that can be selected from a drop-down menu, which, when selected,
will have a text box for the number of items, and comments. <br /></p> The
Artefacts tab will have a button to take an upload a photo now, which will open
a timestamped camera function, and photos can be taken and uploaded automatically.
This page will also have a button for uploading pictures already taken, which
will take the user to the gallery on the tablet, and multiple photos can be
selected and uploaded at once.  The photos can be viewed from the list on the
artefacts tab, and will be able to be deleted if not required using the bin
icon. <br /></p> There will be a side menu down the right hand side with access
to; <br />•	Frequently used links used by the company staff <br/>•	Material
ordering <br/>•	The company intranet site <br/>• Timesheets <br/>•	Leave <br/>•
Refresh button <br /></p>

This program would need to be run on a Samsung Galaxy Tab S4 (or newer), and be
operable as a Chrome or Edge web page for redundancy. It will need to be
programmed in Java. Tablets running this program should have a camera function
in order to take the necessary photos. The program will need to be compatible
with the Office 365 programs that the company uses, to which I currently don’t
have access. <br /></p> I will need to learn more programming skills to be able
to create this program and know what programs would be best to use to create this
sort of application. I would need to know what programs my current workplace
uses, and understand how they function, so my program can use inputs from those
programs, and can export data that can be used. I will need to gain a broader
understanding of file compression, so that I could program that feature into my
program, as some of our work required 30+ photos of a job, and the upload of
these files will need to be reliable and timely.   <br /></p>  The most
straightforward outcome will be a more efficient workforce, which can complete a
job more quickly and efficiently than before. Invoices will be sent
automatically to the customer, reducing load on admin staff, by the employee who
does the work, reducing confusion and mistakes. Another huge benefit will be a
boost in  the morale of the workforce, who will be happier for a program that
suits the type of work they do, that won't freeze or reload while they are
completing tickets of work, and which can compress image files to reduce upload
issues. </p>
