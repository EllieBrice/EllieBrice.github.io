						class="major">Personal Information</h2> <p>My name is Ellie Brice<br
						/> Student number: S3851560<br /> Email Address:
						S3851560@student.rmit.edu.au<br /> <br /> I live in Adelaide, I am
						married to my wife Tamara and we have 3 cats. I spend my free time
						playing Dungeons and Dragons and board games with my friends. I am
						part of the organising committee for the Adelaide Browncoats, a fan
						club of the TV show Firefly and film Serenity, where we plan movie
						screenings and fundraising events to raise money for charity. This
						year I participated in the Relay for Life and my team raised $3,400
						for the Cancer Council. I enjoy fun-runs and obstacle courses, as I
						aim to improve my fitness and live a healthier lifestyle. </p>

						class="major">Interest in IT</h2> <h3>Interest in IT?</h3> <p>I have
						always been mildly interested in it, iv never really had a
						oppertun8ity to act on my desire to learn more about it. When I
						finished school I had several jobs in hospitatlity and chose to
						persue my career without going to uni. I eventaly ended up working
						for Telstra as a technition and as part of that I had the
						opportunity to participate in the rolle out of new pc’s to all the
						staff and that has reignighted my desire to learn more about IT and
						I feel that it may alsdo help with my career as a technician moving
						forward. <br /><br /> I developed an interest in programming after
						using an unsuitable work/dispatch program at my workplace. It rarely
						does what we require it to do, it freezes and reloads when I am
						halfway through a function, and one memorable time after an update
						it wouldn’t allow punctuation in the comments section, in which I
						needed to write a paragraph, and I couldn't figure out why I was
						getting an error and couldn’t complete the job in the system (I only
						found out a week later what caused the problem). It made me want to
						learn programming so I could understand why it was doing these
						things, and theoretically how I could fix and improve it. Nearly all
						of my friends are programmers, which is another reason, so I
						understand what they talk about and can contribute to their
						conversations.   I have also been influenced by recent changes to
						the industry in which I currently work as the amount of work has
						been on the decline, due to outsourcing, switching to cheaper
						contractors rather than staff, and more user friendly (plug and
						play) technology is replacing the need for a technician to come to
						your house to set up your router. <br /><br /> I have a certificate
						3 in Telecommunications & I am Trained in: <br /> Copper jointing,
						cabling and fault finding.<br /> Structured cabling (Cat5and
						Cat6)<br /> Fibre Optic splicing.<br /> Coaxial cabling, jointing
						and fault finding<br /> IT SUPPOORT FOR OTHER STAFF WITHIN MY
						SECTION<br /> Windows upgrades and national roll out of new PC’s<br
						/> Into to Networking & TCP/IP </p>

<h3>Why RMIT?</h3> <p> I chose to study online as this was the best option while
working full time and online university course can fit around my dailty
schedule. I want to get a new job and it is the only was to et qualifications
while working full time. RMIT offered the course I wanted and seemed to be one
of the best rated online universities.</p>

<h3>What do you expect to learn?</h3> <p>I expect to learn programming in my
Bachelor of IT studies and I expect to be a qualified, competent and employable
programmer at the end of the course, and able to get a job in the field, I hope
that as part of this course it will give me a better understanding of the
different aspects of IT so that I can pick a direction to refine my studies.</p>

						Add Link: Java - Web Developer</a></p></h3> </div>

						<h3>Description of the Postion</h3> <p>The position is for a web
						developer, who has plenty of experience with Java and can work with
						technical and non-technical teams to create great custom websites.
						This job appeals to me as it describes “making experiences people
						love” which is something that I want to achieve with programming.
						</p>

						<h3>Skills and Qualifications Required</h3> <p>The position requires
						me to have at least 5 years experience in JAVA HTML CSS & Jscriop,
						It also speaks of programs called  Tomcat & Maven which I have no
						knowledge of as well as looking for someone who is good at time
						management and documentation systems like version control and issue
						tracking while being able to work withon a team. </p>

						<h3>Skills and Qualifications I have</h3> <p>I currently don’t have
						any of the formal qualifications required for this position, but I
						believe I do have time management, prioritisation and organisational
						skills required. I am resourceful and enjoy problem solving.
						Improving an application is my project idea. I have spent the last 7
						years working in technical support, teaching people from all
						backgrounds how to use their IT equipment so I have a lot of
						experience explaining in layman’s terms how complex technology
						works. I feel that I am skilled in working in technical and
						non-technical teams.    </p>

						<h3>The Plan</h3> <p>I am going to finish this degree and then look
						for a potion that will allow me to gain experience in Maven & Tomcat
						while building on the skills I will learn in this course. Ideally I
						would get an entry level web design position so that I can keep my
						Java and CSS skills up to date while furthering my knowledge and
						gaining experience.   </p></div>

						test: INFP (Introvert, Intuition, Feeling, Perceiving)(3)<br />
						Result of Institute of Psychometric mechanical test: 7/10(4)<br />
						</p> <h3>Interpritation of Results</h3> <p>The test results show
						that I am a quiet, introverted person, who explores ideas and
						concepts, who considers the effect I have on others and who can be
						flexible and adaptable while having a above average ability to
						reason out mechanical principles.<br /></p>  <p>I get along well
						with others, but I’m not much of a leader as it doesn’t come
						naturally to me.<br /> </p> <p>I need to be aware that I will need
						make an effort to communicate more when working in a team, and while
						I am flexible and easy going, I should think about my opinions and
						express them in group decision making. </p>

				class="major">Project Idea</h2> <p>For my Project I will write a job dispatching program that can be used to input job data, create a ticket of work for an employee to follow, allow for progress photos to be taken of the work undertaken by the employee, compresses and uploads those photos to a central server as the employee saves them, thus reducing load when the ticket of work is completed. Will allow for the employee to enter detailed comments of the work conducted, and select materials and additional charges, which will then be automatically compiled into an invoice to be sent to the customer.

Motivation 100 words
Promise is the name of a program that I use at work. It is difficult to use, as it is poorly adapted to the specific functions my employer requires me to use it for. My project is to write a better program, specifically suited to the functions required, so all my fellow employees are not wasting time and becoming disillusioned trying to use a program to complete their work that lets them down in so many ways. I want to create a program that is very intuitive, so users will feel like they have used this program for years.

Description 500 words

This program will have a main page, where jobs will have a summary displayed so the technicians can organise their day. Once the technician opens the job, there will be 4 pages; the Details tab, the Testing tab, the Closure tab and the Artefacts tab.
The Details tab will include:
•	The work order number
•	Customer address
•	Customer contact information
•	Cable details, including locations of the exchange, cabinet and pillar
•	A description of the fault, including fault as described by the customer when reported, test results and the location of faults that have been fixed recently.
•	A scope of the work required by a 3rd party should the job be contract work.
	The testing tab will have access to online testing through the company’s testing facility, which will return a result in approximately 1 minute.
The closure tab will have ‘Complete’ and ‘Incomplete’ buttons, which will change which page is displayed. The incomplete page will have a drop-down menu to select the reason the job can’t be completed, and a comments box for compulsory comments for the technician to elaborate. The completion page will show relevant options for completion, as well as billable items that can be selected from a drop-down menu, which, when selected, will have a text box for the number of items, and comments.


Tools and Technologies 100 words
This program would need to be run on a Samsung Galaxy Tab S2 (or newer), and be operable as a web page for redundancy.

Skills Required 100 words
I will need to learn more programming skills to be able to create this program.
Outcome 100 Words
The most straightforward outcome will be a more efficient workforce, which can complete a job more quickly and efficiently than before. Invoices will be sent automatically to the customer, reducing load on admin staff, by the employee who does the work, reducing confusion and mistakes. Another huge benefit will be a boost in  the morale of the workforce, who will be happier for a program that suits the type of work they do, that won't freeze or reload while they are completing tickets of work, and which can compress image files to reduce upload issues.
